= Preface

The first I heard about offshore structures was in 1996 when I was interviewing for my third job. 

After testing my basics, the interviewer asked me if I knew anything about offshore structures. I remember saying not much, and that I thought it was a much narrower field of structural engineering, unsure of the market or opportunities. After a week of deliberating on the risk of venturing into a field unknown to me, I decided to try. It jump-started my learning, recognise my handicaps, develop humility, improve critical thinking, and influence my career along the way.

This monograph is a collection of notes from my experience in engineering offshore structures that I had the privilege of working-on. Independent of each other, I hope they each offer a way to think about the problem at hand, and find at least one way to figure it out. Wherever computer code is employed, it is done so with the purpose of gaining insight. 

I hope you find it useful.
