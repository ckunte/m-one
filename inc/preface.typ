= Preface

'Programming helps bring clarity to a subject like no other,' a colleague once remarked. How true. It requires one to first think about solving a problem, and then simplify it with instructions that a computer can then understand and execute.

My first exposure to a computer was during my second year at the university in 1991-2 while taking _Numerical Techniques & Computer Programming_ course. I learned programming in FORTRAN on paper for 36 weeks, and only two one-hour hands-on sessions near the end of that academic year on an actual computer, and I spent both those hours struggling with the first unfamiliar hurdle: the operating system. This was before even getting to transfer the program, I'd written on paper, on to a time-shared computer so I could try to run it. It was exciting, but also incredibly frustrating.

FORTRAN's handicaps of the time (e.g., fixed format, lacking graphics support, etc.) led me to unlearn much of it post-college years, and look for an alternative. It had to be high-level that was easy to learn, simpler to write, with tons of features, extendable via modules, useful for both general and scientific purposes, and importantly, accessible without a costly license. That turned out to be Python, a language best known for "batteries included." 

For a dozen years now, I have used Python for calculations, convert finite element models, process and graph data, write utilities, a publishing engine, etc. Its ease of use, and versatility makes it a keeper. Once you think hard about the problem you are about to solve, turning it to think in python gets easier, with practice of course.

It's what I did, turning every possible problem into an opportunity to write a little code to not only generate answers, but also, insights.

This book, _binary insights_, is a collection of those. While they are not directly related to each other, and each chapter can be read independent of each other, I hope they each enable a way to think about the problem, and solve it with code.

I hope you like it.
