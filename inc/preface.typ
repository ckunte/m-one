= Preface

'Programming helps bring clarity to a subject like no other,' a colleague once remarked. So true. It requires one to first think about solving the problem, and then simplify it with instructions that a computer can then understand and execute.

My first exposure to a computer hands-on was during my second year at the university in 1991-2 while taking _Numerical Techniques & Computer Programming_ course. I learned programming in FORTRAN on paper for 36 weeks, and just two one-hour hands-on sessions near the end of that academic year on an actual computer: an IBM-compatible PC-XT. I spent both those hours struggling with the first unfamiliar hurdle: the operating system, DOS. This was before even getting to transfer the program, I'd written on paper, on to the time-shared computer so I could try to run it. It was both exciting, and incredibly frustrating.

FORTRAN's handicaps (e.g. fixed format, and lacking graphics support) led me to unlearn much of it post college years. Fast forward to 2006, while struggling with more data than Excel could handle at the time, I was forced to look for a high-level programming language that was easy to learn, with tons of features, extendable via modules, and importantly, accessible without a costly license. That turned out to be Python, a language best known for "batteries included." 

Since then, I have used it for calculations, process and graph data, convert finite element models, write pre and post processing utilities, write a weblog engine, etc. Its versatility makes it a keeper. Once you think hard about the problem you are about to solve, turning it to think in python gets easier, with practice of course. 

It's what I did --- turning every problem into an opportunity to write a little code to not only generate some answers, but more importantly some insights --- by processing more than what was required.

This book, _binary insights_, is a collection of those. While they are not directly related to each other, I hope they each enable a way to think about the problem, before solving it with code. They have existed on my personal website for years; now in a handy mini-book form. I hope you like it.
